# Introduction

This app explores the fascinating realm of worldwide earthquakes, 
aiming to uncover patterns, extract insights, and gain a deeper 
understanding of these seismic events that shape our planet. 
By analyzing a dataset spanning multiple regions and time periods,
we embark on a journey to explore the nature of earthquakes and their 
impact on our world.



# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways

All the visualizations and analysis have revealed the high extent of the 
dangers of the circum-Pacific seismic belt. This area is experiencing the 
highest frequency of intense magnitude earthquakes with magnitudes exceeding 8. 
These large magnitude earthquakes can cause extensive damage to infrastructure,
trigger landslides, and potentially generate tsunamis. The plot does indicate 
that tsunamis are predominantly generated by earthquakes located in areas 
surrounding the Pacific Ocean. This implies that the circum-Pacific seismic belt
is one of the most dangerous seismic zones on Earth, and itâ€™s necessary to enhance
protection measures among these areas.
